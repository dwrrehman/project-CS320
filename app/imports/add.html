// this is not taking into account that fact that if we add a new unit like meter, we need to supply the conversion factor, but if we add one like newton, and we already have meter, kg, and seconds defined, then we dont have to give conversion factors.

// this makes making a new unit rather tricky... we probably need two differnt "add" pages, one for adding compound units, and one for adding units of a different system.


// it should be noted that we will never want to convert between units of a different class.

// oh yeah that reminds me, also, we have to add a class for each unit, (which is a user defined class, which could be metric, imperial, etc...). a user can define a new class, define a new base unit in that class, and define a new compound unit based on exiosting units in that class that they are extending.


// do thats hwo adding units will work.
