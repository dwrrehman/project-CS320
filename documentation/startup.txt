How to Start up the application:
----------------------------------------

this application preferentially uses a node.js package called http-server to start up the server. 

if you dont have this package already, use this command:

    "npm install -g http-server"

(dont forget to use sudo if you are on Mac...)

once you have cd'd into the project-CS32/source directory, run the command "http-server -c-1". 

then just point your browser to the ip and port provided by the command, and marvel at our amazing UI. :P
