Project Name: Calculation Utility.
Project Members: Daniel, Jake, and Andrew.
Date: 2018, Oct 6.


Introduction: ------------------------------------------------------------

This project is a Calculation Utility, which allows the user to calculate numbers using a calculator, graph user defined functions, convert existing units to other units, define new units, visualize the unit conversion using graphics, as well as list all current units defined. It is a web appllication written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

section 1.1: ------------------------------------------------------------

This document serves as a comprehensive overview of version 0.1 of our Calculation Utility project. The project is in its initial stages and ideas are still being formed, so the scope and details of functionality described here are tentative.

section 1.2: ------------------------------------------------------------

section 2.1 ------------------------------------------------------------

The Calulation Utility is a new, standalone web application. It can be used by anyone with access to the internet, but would primarily be of use to engineers, mathematicians, and those in similar fields. The UI allows the user to select the desired units to convert to and from, to define a new unit, or to use the calculator. Results of a unit conversion or calculation are displayed to the user. A separate page displays a list of all available units and their descriptions.

section 2.2 ------------------------------------------------------------

The product, Calculation Utility, must be able to convert units, define additional units for converting, and list available units already defined. As it contains a calculator, this product must also be able to perform basic arithematic on numbers given by the user, as well as perform calulations using user defined functions, and make a tumb-nail graph these user defined functions in a list format, when the user views these functions.

It should also be able to store any values returned by either the converter or the calculator in a set of variables and constants, that can be loaded from at any time.

section 2.3 ------------------------------------------------------------






section 2.4 ------------------------------------------------------------




section 2.5 ------------------------------------------------------------

The primary constraints on this product are the required programming languages and development schedule. To meet the project requirements, the program must be created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Development must also follow a strict schedule, and be completed by the end of the Fall 2018 school semester. These constraints will limit the number of features that can be implemented.


section 2.6 ------------------------------------------------------------

User documentation will exist solely on the website as part of the UI. The product is fairly simple, so simple directions placed directly in the website should be sufficient to guide the user.


section 2.7 ------------------------------------------------------------

This product will use the Javascript Underscore Library


section 3.1.1: ------------------------------------------------------------


:Prompt:
User Interfaces
<Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., Cancel) that will appear on every screen, error message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed.
TO DO: The least you can do for this section is to describe in words the different User Interfaces and the different screens that will be available to the user. Optional: You may also provide an initial Graphical User Interface design (does not have to be final).>

section 3.1.2: ------------------------------------------------------------

:Prompt:
Hardware Interfaces
<Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware. You are not required to specify what protocols you will be using to communicate with the hardware, but it will be usually included in this part as well.
TO DO: Please provide a short description of the different hardware interfaces. If you will be using some special libraries to communicate with your software mention them here. In case you have more than one hardware interface divide this section into subsections.>
:Prompt:


section 3.1.3: ------------------------------------------------------------

:Prompt:
Software Interfaces
<Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems (Windows? Linux? Etc…), tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.  
TO DO: The previous part illustrates some of the information you would usually include in this part of the SRS document. To make things simpler, you are only required to describe the specific interface with the operating system.>
